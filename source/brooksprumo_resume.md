### [Pegasus Solutions](http://www.pegs.com)

_Austin, TX_

_November 2016 - Present_

- Port primary business logic from 32-bit K&R C built on Solairs to 64-bit ANSI C99 build on Linux

### [National Instruments](http://www.ni.com)

_Austin, TX_

#### Senior Software Engineer

_February 2015 - November 2016_

- Lead team to add support for new USRP hardware in LabVIEW.
- Developed drivers and applications for Massive MIMO, 5G, and WiFi research in C++ and LabVIEW.
- Emphasized user experience, API design, TDD, and maintainable software.
- Lead team through multiple releases across multiple versions of LabVIEW and operating systems.
- Member of cross-group RF Architectures team on synchronization.

#### Staff Software Engineer

_2012 - February 2015_

- Designed and implemented multi-device synchronization algorithms that would be used with the USRP RIO to enable and patent [Massive MIMO](http://www.ni.com/rf/5g/) research (100+ antenna systems).
- Wrote full software stack to support [USRP RIO](http://www.ni.com/sdr/usrp-rio/) in [LabVIEW FPGA](http://www.ni.com/labview/fpga/). This includes the kernel driver (for Windows and Linux) in C++, a user-mode shared library in C++, the LabVIEW device configuration library on the host and FPGA, and LabVIEW sample projects for users to customize.
- Developed FPGA applications and libraries for RF, signal-based synchronization, time-based synchronization, and high data throughput in LabVIEW FPGA.

#### Software Engineer

_March 2010 - 2012_

- Wrote content for high-throughput training in LabVIEW FPGA.
- Ported an NI device library from Windows to Linux that enabled sales to a large customer.

## EDUCATION

### [Georgia Institute of Technology](http://www.gatech.edu)

_Atlanta, GA_

_August 2007 - May 2009_

- MS in Computer Science with a concentration in Computer Architecture
- Cumulative GPA: 3.71/4.00
- Research on 3D DRAM, integrated DRAM-on-chip, and multi-core cache insertion/promotion policies. Resulted in an ISCA workshop (CMP-MSI) publication on multi-core caching policies (see below). Implemented design in Zesto, a modern multi-core SimpleScalar based x86 simulator written in C++, for evaluation.
- Research on low-power dynamic compilation. Created a power optimization for LLVM, written in C++, that executed binaries and dynamically optimized them for low-power functional unit power gating. Evaluated design with a modified PTLSim, an x86 simulator
- High performance computing and multi-threaded development with C/C++, pthreads, OpenMP, and CUDA. Projects involved shared memory programming, message passing, GPGPU programming, various forms of interprocess communication and remote procedure calls, and simulator development.
