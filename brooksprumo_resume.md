## EDUCATION

### [Georgia Institute of Technology](http://www.gatech.edu)

_Atlanta, GA_

_August 2007 - May 2009_

- MS in Computer Science with a concentration in Computer Architecture
- Cumulative GPA: 3.71/4.00
- Research on 3D DRAM, integrated DRAM-on-chip, and multi-core cache insertion/promotion policies. Resulted in an ISCA workshop (CMP-MSI) publication on multi-core caching policies (see below). Implemented design in Zesto, a modern multi-core SimpleScalar based x86 simulator, for evaluation.
- Research on low-power dynamic compilation. Created a power optimization for LLVM that executed binaries and dynamically optimized them for low-power functional unit power gating. Evaluated design with a modified PTLSim, an x86 simulator
- High performance computing and multi-threaded development with C/C++, pthreads, OpenMP, and CUDA. Projects involved shared memory programming, message passing, GPGPU programming, various forms of interprocess communication and remote procedure calls, and simulator development.
